CodeTorch
=====================

**CodeTorch** is a open source project that aims to increase developer productivity by providing a configuration-driven approach to development.

Rather than spend time coding routines that are fairly straight-forward (like CRUD but not limited to CRUD) it provides common development scenarios (ready made templates) that are configured in a simple IDE.

**Why you'll love CodeTorch:**
* Configuration-Only driven development
