steps to add a new section
1. Create class that inherits from BaseSection - this goes in portable
2. add custom properties you will use for configuration purposes
3. add attributes to support proper serialization from designer - 
***used in Screen.Sections
***used in EdiableGridSection.Sections
4. Create class (Renderer) that inherits from BaseSectionControl - 
typically named SectionControl - this goes in platform specific project and also has a property called Me that
is tied to the fully qualified type in PCL; override/implement the needed methods so it can populate and be rendered
5. ***RESOLVED*** add class to SectionCollectionEditor.CreateNewItemTypes - this is so we can add a new section in designer

6. Add configuration of section to your configs SectionTypes.xml
7. Rebuild config dll - test
