steps to add a new section
1. Create class that inherits from Section - this goes in portable
2. add custom properties you will use for configuration purposes
3. Create class (Renderer) that inherits from BaseSectionControl - 
typically named SectionControl - this goes in platform specific project and also has a property called Me that
is tied to the fully qualified type in PCL; override/implement the needed methods so it can populate and be rendered
4. Add configuration of section to your configs SectionTypes.xml
5. Rebuild config dll - test
